As organizations grow, maintaining alignment and clear communication becomes increasingly challenging. For Passenger, a mobile ticketing solutions provider, these challenges came to a head as their team structure struggled to keep up with rapid growth and shifting user needs. Using **User Needs Mapping**, Passenger was able to uncover opportunities for better alignment, reduce cognitive load, and improve the flow of value delivery. This case study explores how they achieved these results.

## The challenge: Growing pains in a scaling organization

Passenger began as a small, tightly knit team in 2015, offering white-label mobile ticketing solutions for public transport operators. By 2020, they had grown significantly, fueled by a global shift toward contactless payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team landed a major deal with Go-Ahead, one of the UK’s largest transport operators, and demand for their solutions surged.

However, with this growth came challenges:
- **Overloaded communication channels:** Daily standups involved nearly everyone because it was the only way to stay informed.
- **Unclear responsibilities:** With one large team owning all capabilities, there was no clear ownership, leading to inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
- **Cognitive overload:** Teams struggled to manage the increasing complexity of their work.

Passenger needed a way to restructure their teams and align their capabilities to better serve their users while reducing cognitive load.

## The solution: Applying User Needs Mapping

Passenger turned to User Needs Mapping as a practical tool to identify user needs, map organizational capabilities, and define clearer team boundaries. Here’s how they applied the process:

### 1. Identifying users

The first step was to identify all the users interacting with Passenger’s systems. This included:
- **External users:**
  - Bus passengers who needed to plan journeys, buy tickets, and board buses.
  - Transport operators’ scheduling and marketing teams.
- **Internal users:**
  - Customer service teams who relied on internal tools to support end-users.

### 2. Defining user needs

Next, they defined the needs of each user group, focusing on verbs to describe actions. For example:
- A bus passenger might need to:
  - Buy a ticket.
  - Use the ticket to board a bus.
  - Plan their journey.
- A scheduling team might need to:
  - Publish accurate timetable data.
  - Meet government reporting requirements.

### 3. Mapping capabilities

The team then mapped organizational capabilities to these needs, creating a dependency tree to visualize the relationships. For example:
- **Need:** “Buy a ticket”
  - **Capabilities:** Mobile app interface, payment gateway, ticket validation system.
- **Need:** “Publish timetable data”
  - **Capabilities:** Scheduling tools, compliance management systems.

### 4. Visualizing the big picture

The mapping process revealed a “big ball of mud”—a tangled web of dependencies and overlapping responsibilities. They overlaid their existing team structure on the map and quickly saw the problem: one large team owned all capabilities, making it impossible to scale effectively.

### 5. Defining new team boundaries

Using the map, Passenger identified potential team boundaries by grouping capabilities that served similar needs. For example:
- A **“Ticketing and Payments” team** was proposed to own all capabilities related to buying and validating tickets.
- A **“Journey Planning” team** was proposed to handle scheduling tools and journey planning interfaces.

These boundaries aimed to reduce dependencies between teams while ensuring each team had clear ownership of its domain.

## The results: Clarity and alignment

By adopting the new team structure, Passenger achieved several key outcomes:

### 1. Improved alignment
Teams were better aligned with the needs of their users. Each team’s responsibilities were clear, and their focus areas were well-defined.

### 2. Reduced cognitive load
Breaking down the large, multi-functional team into smaller, focused teams reduced cognitive load, enabling team members to work more effectively.

### 3. Faster flow of value
Clear ownership of capabilities allowed teams to make decisions faster, leading to quicker delivery of features and updates.

### 4. Scalability
The new structure provided a scalable foundation as Passenger continued to grow. Future team evolution could be guided by the same User Needs Mapping principles.

## Lessons learned

Passenger’s journey highlights several important lessons for organizations considering User Needs Mapping:

1. **Start with users:** Focusing on user needs ensures that team structures align with delivering value.
2. **Visualize dependencies:** Mapping capabilities reveals bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.
3. **Iterate:** Team boundaries should evolve over time as user needs and organizational goals change.

## Conclusion

User Needs Mapping helped Passenger navigate the complexities of growth and transition from a chaotic, overloaded structure to a streamlined, user-focused organization. By starting with their users and mapping their needs, they unlocked a scalable and efficient team design that positioned them for future success.

If your organization is facing similar challenges, consider starting with a User Needs Mapping exercise. It’s a practical and accessible way to uncover insights, align teams, and deliver value with greater clarity and efficiency.
