Understanding your users’ needs is the cornerstone of delivering value. But what drives these needs? The **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)** framework provides a powerful way to uncover the deeper motivations behind user actions. By identifying the "jobs" users are trying to accomplish, you can frame their needs in a way that guides strategic decisions and aligns your teams effectively.

In this article, we’ll explore how to identify user needs through the JTBD lens, turning abstract motivations into actionable insights.

## What is Jobs to Be Done?

Jobs to Be Done is a framework that shifts the focus from what users do to why they do it. It examines the progress users seek when they “hire” a product, service, or process. These "jobs" encompass:
- **Functional needs:** The practical tasks users want to complete.
- **Emotional needs:** The feelings users seek to achieve or avoid.
- **Social needs:** The ways users want to be perceived by others.

By understanding these dimensions, you can uncover not only what users want but also the deeper context driving their behavior.

## Steps to Identify User Needs Using JTBD

### 1. Define the Job Context

Start by understanding the situation in which the user is operating. Jobs are always context-dependent, influenced by the user’s environment, constraints, and goals.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is the user trying to achieve in this situation?
- What triggers their need to act?
- What constraints or challenges do they face?

**Example:**
For a commuter:
- Context: The user is commuting to work during peak hours.
- Goal: They want to arrive on time without unnecessary stress.
- Constraint: Limited time to purchase tickets or adjust plans.

### 2. Interview Your Users

Conduct interviews to uncover the jobs your users are trying to accomplish. Focus on their actions, motivations, and frustrations.

**Tips for effective interviews:**
- **Ask about the past:** Instead of hypothetical scenarios, ask users about their actual experiences.
- **Focus on progress:** Explore what users were trying to achieve, not just what they did.
- **Dig deeper:** Use follow-up questions to uncover the "why" behind their actions.

**Example Questions:**
- What was the last time you needed to [complete a specific task]?
- What steps did you take, and why?
- What obstacles did you encounter?
- How did you feel during the process?

---

### 3. Identify Desired Outcomes

From your interviews, extract the outcomes users are trying to achieve. These outcomes represent their functional, emotional, and social goals.

**Example Outcomes:**
For a commuter:
- **Functional:** Purchase a ticket quickly and easily.
- **Emotional:** Feel confident they won’t miss their bus.
- **Social:** Avoid appearing disorganized or rushed.

### 4. Translate Jobs into Actionable User Needs

Once you’ve identified the jobs and outcomes, translate them into user needs that are specific, actionable, and framed from the user’s perspective. Use verbs to describe what the user wants to achieve.

**Example User Needs:**
- Quickly buy a ticket using a mobile app.
- Receive real-time updates about bus delays.
- Plan a commute with confidence and minimal effort.

---

### 5. Prioritize Needs Based on Impact

Not all needs are equally important. Use prioritization to focus on the jobs and needs that have the greatest impact on your users’ success and satisfaction.

**Prioritization Criteria:**
- **Frequency:** How often does this job occur?
- **Importance:** How critical is this job to the user’s goals?
- **Frustration level:** How significant are the pain points associated with this job?

**Example Prioritization:**
- **High Priority:** Buying tickets quickly during peak hours.
- **Medium Priority:** Planning commutes for future dates.
- **Low Priority:** Customizing app themes for aesthetic preferences.

## Using JTBD Insights to Align Your Organization

Identifying user needs through the JTBD lens doesn’t stop at understanding—it’s about action. Use these insights to:

### Align Teams
- Ensure teams own capabilities that directly address high-priority user needs.
- Minimize dependencies by grouping related capabilities under cohesive team boundaries.

### Inform Design and Development
- Design features and systems that directly fulfill the jobs users are hiring your product or service to do.
- Validate solutions against user needs to ensure they deliver the intended outcomes.

### Guide Strategy
- Use JTBD insights to prioritize investments and initiatives that align with your users’ most critical jobs.
- Focus on areas where your organization can uniquely excel in meeting user needs.
