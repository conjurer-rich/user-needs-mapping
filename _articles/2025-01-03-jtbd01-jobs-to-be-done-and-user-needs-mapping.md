Understanding what drives your users is crucial for delivering products and services that truly meet their needs. While **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)** focuses on uncovering the underlying motivations behind user actions, **User Needs Mapping** provides a framework for aligning teams and capabilities to meet those needs. Together, these methodologies offer a powerful approach to driving value and aligning your organization around user goals.

In this article, we’ll explore how to combine Jobs to Be Done with User Needs Mapping, creating a complementary approach that uncovers deeper insights and informs team alignment.

## What is Jobs to Be Done?

Jobs to Be Done is a framework that helps organizations understand why users "hire" a product or service to fulfill a specific task or solve a problem. It shifts the focus from demographics or features to the functional, emotional, and social progress users seek.

### Key principles of JTBD:
1. **Focus on the job, not the user:** Understand the progress users are trying to make.
2. **Explore functional, emotional, and social dimensions:** Consider all aspects of the user’s context and motivations.
3. **Context matters:** The situation and environment influence how users approach their jobs.

**Example JTBD Statement:**
> “When I’m commuting to work, I want a quick and seamless way to buy a bus ticket so that I can avoid delays and get to my destination on time.”

## How User Needs Mapping complements JTBD

While JTBD focuses on understanding user motivations, User Needs Mapping provides a practical framework for aligning organizational capabilities and team structures around those needs. By integrating these approaches, you can:

1. **Bridge strategy and execution:** Use JTBD insights to inform User Needs Mapping and ensure organizational alignment with user priorities.
2. **Enhance clarity:** Translate the abstract motivations of JTBD into actionable needs and capabilities.
3. **Drive team alignment:** Align teams and systems around fulfilling the jobs users are hiring your product or service to do.

## Steps to Combine JTBD with User Needs Mapping

### 1. Identify Jobs to Be Done

Start by conducting JTBD research to uncover the key jobs your users are trying to accomplish. Use interviews, observations, and surveys to explore:
- What progress are users trying to make?
- What obstacles do they face?
- What functional, emotional, and social factors influence their decisions?

**Output:** A list of prioritized JTBD statements that reflect your users’ goals and challenges.

### 2. Define User Needs

Translate each JTBD statement into specific, actionable user needs. These needs should be:
- **User-centric:** Framed from the user’s perspective.
- **Actionable:** Described using verbs to highlight desired outcomes.

**Example:**
- JTBD: "When I’m commuting to work, I want a quick and seamless way to buy a bus ticket."
- User Needs:
  - Buy a ticket quickly and easily.
  - Use the ticket to board a bus without delays.
  - Get real-time updates on bus schedules.

### 3. Map Organizational Capabilities

Using the defined user needs, map the organizational capabilities required to meet them. Capabilities might include systems, processes, or teams that support the user’s desired outcomes.

**Example Map:**
- **Need:** "Buy a ticket quickly and easily."
  - **Capabilities:** Mobile app interface, payment gateway, ticket validation system.
- **Need:** "Get real-time updates on bus schedules."
  - **Capabilities:** Scheduling tools, notification systems, GPS tracking.

### 4. Visualize Dependencies and Team Structures

Overlay your existing team structures on the capability map to identify:
- Gaps where no team owns a critical capability.
- Overlaps that create inefficiencies or bottlenecks.
- Dependencies between teams that may hinder fast flow.

### 5. Align Teams with Jobs and Needs

Use insights from the capability map to design team boundaries that:
- Minimize dependencies and maximize ownership.
- Align with the jobs and needs users prioritize.
- Ensure cognitive load remains manageable for each team.

**Example Team Structure:**
- A "Ticketing and Payments" team focused on all capabilities related to buying and validating tickets.
- A "Real-Time Updates" team responsible for scheduling tools and notification systems.

- **Improved alignment:** Teams are structured around delivering the outcomes users care about most.
- **Faster value delivery:** Clear ownership and reduced dependencies enable teams to deliver results more efficiently.
- **Scalability:** The combined approach provides a scalable framework for aligning teams as your organization grows.
