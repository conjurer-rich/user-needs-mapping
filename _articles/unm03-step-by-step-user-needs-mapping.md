User Needs Mapping is a practical and accessible tool for organizations looking to align their teams, reduce cognitive load, and improve the flow of value. By focusing on users and their needs, this technique provides actionable insights for defining team and service boundaries. This article walks you through the step-by-step process of User Needs Mapping, complete with practical tips and examples to help you get started.

## Step 1: Identify your users

The first step in User Needs Mapping is to identify your users. These users can include both external customers and internal stakeholders, such as platform teams or operational staff.

### Tips for identifying users:
- **Think broadly:** Consider all the people who interact with your organization, from end customers to employees.
- **Group similar users:** For simplicity, group users with similar needs into categories (e.g., “customers,” “operations teams”).
- **Include internal users:** Don’t forget about platform teams, developers, and other internal stakeholders who rely on your systems.

**Example:** For a mobile ticketing company, users might include:
- Bus passengers
- Operators’ scheduling teams
- Operators’ marketing teams
- Internal customer service teams

## Step 2: Define user needs

Once you’ve identified your users, the next step is to define their needs. These should be described from the user’s perspective, using clear and actionable language.

### Tips for defining needs:
- **Focus on verbs:** Use action-oriented language (e.g., “buy a ticket” rather than “ticket purchase”).
- **Avoid solutions:** Describe the problem or goal, not the solution (e.g., “plan a journey” rather than “use our journey planner tool”).
- **Validate with users:** Ensure the language resonates with real users.

**Example:**
- A bus passenger might need to:
  - Buy a ticket
  - Use the ticket to board a bus
  - Plan their journey
- An operator’s scheduling team might need to:
  - Publish journey schedules
  - Meet government regulations

## Step 3: Map capabilities to needs

With user needs defined, the next step is to map organizational capabilities to those needs. Capabilities are the functions or systems your organization uses to meet specific user needs.

### Tips for mapping capabilities:
- **Create a dependency tree:** Visualize how capabilities support user needs and depend on one another.
- **Be detailed:** Include both technical systems (e.g., databases, APIs) and human processes (e.g., customer support).
- **Identify gaps:** Look for needs that lack clear supporting capabilities.

**Example:**
For the need “buy a ticket,” the capabilities might include:
- Mobile app interface
- Payment gateway integration
- Ticket validation system

## Step 4: Visualize and analyze the map

Now it’s time to create a visual representation of your users, needs, and capabilities. This map serves as a tool for discussion and decision-making.

### Tips for visualization:
- **Keep it simple:** Use clear labels and avoid clutter.
- **Highlight dependencies:** Show how capabilities are linked and where bottlenecks exist.
- **Overlay current teams:** Indicate which teams currently own each capability to identify overlaps or gaps.

**Example:**
A visual map might show:
- Bus passengers’ needs linked to capabilities like the mobile app and ticketing systems.
- Operators’ needs linked to scheduling tools and compliance databases.
- Current team ownership across these capabilities.

## Step 5: Identify potential team boundaries

Using the map, explore options for restructuring team boundaries to align with user needs and minimize dependencies. The goal is to design teams that can operate independently while reducing cognitive load.

### Tips for identifying boundaries:
- **Look for natural clusters:** Group capabilities that serve a common set of needs.
- **Minimize cross-team dependencies:** Aim for self-sufficient teams with clear ownership.
- **Apply Team Topologies principles:** Consider stream-aligned teams, enabling teams, and platform teams.

**Example:**
Based on the map, you might identify:
- A “Ticketing and Payments” team responsible for all capabilities related to ticket purchase and validation.
- A “Journey Planning” team focused on journey scheduling and planning tools.

---

## Step 6: Validate and iterate

Finally, test your proposed team boundaries and iterate based on feedback. This process is rarely perfect on the first attempt and should evolve as your organization grows and changes.

### Tips for validation:
- **Engage stakeholders:** Involve team members and leaders in reviewing the proposed structure.
- **Run simulations:** Test how the new boundaries would handle real-world scenarios.
- **Be flexible:** Adjust boundaries as new needs or challenges emerge.

## Final thoughts

User Needs Mapping is a powerful tool for uncovering insights about team and service alignment. By focusing on users and their needs, organizations can create structures that reduce cognitive load, improve flow, and deliver value more effectively. While it’s inspired by frameworks like Wardley Mapping and Domain-Driven Design, its simplicity makes it accessible to teams at any stage of their journey.

Ready to put User Needs Mapping into action? Start small, iterate, and watch as your teams align more closely with the needs of your users. In our next article, we’ll share a real-world case study demonstrating the transformative power of this technique. Stay tuned!
