# Quick Start Guide: User Needs Mapping with a Moviegoer Example

## What You’ll Learn

This guide walks you through **User Needs Mapping** with a focus on the **Job to Be Done (JTBD)** framework. Using a moviegoer’s journey, you’ll learn to define user needs, identify capabilities, and group them into logical boundaries that support both the user’s overarching job and organizational delivery.

---

## **Step 1: Define the Job to Be Done**

Start by identifying the core **Job to Be Done** for your user. For the moviegoer, the JTBD might look like this:

> **Core JTBD:**  
> *"When I want to relax or spend quality time with others, I want to choose, book, and attend a movie that matches my preferences and schedule, so that I feel entertained and confident my plans will go smoothly."*

This JTBD includes:
- **Functional needs**: Choosing a movie, booking tickets, attending.  
- **Emotional needs**: Feeling entertained and confident in the process.  
- **Social needs**: Sharing the experience with others.

---

## **Step 2: Define the User Journey**

Map out the steps the user takes to complete the job. For the moviegoer, the journey might include:

1. **Discover a movie**: Find what’s playing, trailers, and reviews.  
2. **Select a showtime**: Choose a convenient time and location.  
3. **Book tickets**: Reserve seats and pay.  
4. **Receive confirmation**: Get proof of the booking.  
5. **Attend the movie**: Use the ticket to gain entry and enjoy the movie.  
6. **Provide feedback**: Share reviews or social experiences.

---

## **Step 3: Identify User Needs**

For each step in the journey, identify **why** the user performs that step—their specific needs. Ensure these align with the JTBD:

### **1. Discover a movie**
- I need to find a movie that matches my interests and schedule.  
- I need enough information to decide if the movie is worth watching.

### **2. Select a showtime**
- I need to know when and where I can watch the movie.  
- I need options that fit my preferences (e.g., location, accessibility).  

### **3. Book tickets**
- I need a simple way to reserve seats for my chosen movie.  
- I need confidence that my payment is secure and my booking is confirmed.

### **4. Receive confirmation**
- I need proof of my booking that’s easy to access and use.  
- I need reminders so I don’t forget the showtime.

### **5. Attend the movie**
- I need a seamless experience to enter and enjoy the movie without delays.  
- I need my pre-booked services (e.g., snacks) ready when I arrive.  

### **6. Provide feedback**
- I need a quick way to share my opinion or experience.  
- I need to feel that my feedback matters and influences future offerings.

## **Step 4: Identify Underlying Capabilities**

Next, determine the organizational capabilities required to meet these needs. Each capability supports the journey and the overall JTBD. For example:

### **Discover a movie**
- Movie listing API integration.  
- Content management system for trailers and reviews.

### **Select a showtime**
- Showtime scheduling database.  
- Filtering and search capabilities.

### **Book tickets**
- Real-time seat availability system.  
- Secure payment gateway integration.

### **Receive confirmation**
- Ticket generation service (e.g., QR codes).  
- Notification system for reminders.

### **Attend the movie**
- QR code scanner for ticket validation.  
- Concession ordering and fulfillment system.

### **Provide feedback**
- Review and rating submission system.  
- Social media integration for sharing.

## **Step 5: Group Capabilities into Logical Boundaries**

Use principles of **cognitive load** and **ownership** to group related capabilities into team or service boundaries. For example:

- **Discovery & Selection Team**  
   - Responsible for movie listings, showtimes, and reviews.

- **Ticketing & Payment Team**  
   - Manages seat selection, payment, and ticket generation.

- **Experience Team**  
   - Focuses on ticket validation and pre-booked services.

- **Feedback Team**  
   - Handles review submissions and social engagement features.

---

## **Step 6: Validate the Map**

Collaborate with your teams to validate the map by:
- Discussing dependencies and potential bottlenecks.  
- Assessing cognitive load for each team.  
- Ensuring alignment with the user’s core JTBD.  

---

## **Step 7: Monitor & Iterate**

After implementing your User Needs Map, continuously monitor:
- How well each team delivers on their responsibilities.  
- Whether user needs are consistently being met.  
- Any emerging gaps or new requirements that need attention.

---

## **Real-World Example Outcome**

In a similar exercise for a movie ticketing platform, teams discovered:
- A dependency between ticket generation and notification systems was causing delays.  
- Addressing this dependency early improved user satisfaction and reduced issues during high-traffic periods.
