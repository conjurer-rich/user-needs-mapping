### A practical, hands-on guide for uncovering what really matters — and designing your teams around it

Whether you’re leading a digital transformation, scaling a product organization, or simply trying to reduce internal friction, this book shows you how to expose the invisible forces that are holding your teams back — and what to do about them.
