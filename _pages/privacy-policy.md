## Sales and consultancy data policy

### What this policy applies to

Where we refer to Data Protection Law below this means;

* unless and until the GDPR is no longer directly applicable in the UK, the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, as amended or updated from time to time, in the UK, and then
* any successor legislation to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 2018.

Your privacy is important to us and we will process your data in accordance with Data Protection Law. This says that the personal information we hold about you must be:

* Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.
* Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.
* Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.
* Accurate and kept up to date.
* Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.
* Kept securely.
* You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.

### The kind of information we hold about you

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data that has been truly anonymised. We will collect, store, and use the following categories of personal information about you:

* Identity Data such as first name, last name and title.
* Contact Data such as addresses, telephone numbers, and personal email addresses.

### If you fail to provide personal information

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

### How is your personal information collected?

You may give us your personal data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you:

* Sign up to newsletters.
* Sign up to email updates.
* Request demos and other interactive features.
* Inbound email or phone calls

### How we will use information about you

We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to.

To administer and protect our business (including, sales & marketing activity, essential and nonessential communication, troubleshooting, data analysis, support, reporting) we will use your personal information where it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests (running our business, provision of administration and IT services, network security, to prevent fraud and in the context of a business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise), or those of a third party, but only where your interests and fundamental rights do not override our interests.

We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:

* where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests); or
* where it is needed in the public interest.

### Situations in which we will use your personal information

We need all the categories of information we keep about you primarily to allow us to use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties, provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. The situations in which we will process your personal information are listed below:

* To provide the relevant service or feature that you have requested.
* To manage your preferences.
* To gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our newsletters and email subscriptions.
* To conduct data analytics studies to review and better understand how and when people interact with us and our products.
* Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.

You will have the ability to unsubscribe from any repeat communications at any time.

### Change of purpose

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

### Data sharing

We may have to share your data with third parties, including third-party service providers. We require third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We may transfer your personal information outside the EU, as set out in "Transferring information outside the EU" below. If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.

### Why might you share my personal information with third parties?

We will share your personal information with third parties where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the working relationship with you or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.

### Which third-party service providers process my personal information?

"Third parties" includes third-party service providers (including contractors, designated agents, and software provisions). The following categories of third-party service providers process personal information about you for the following purposes:

* Service providers acting as processors based in the UK and US who provide IT, development system administration services or software.

* HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

### How secure is my information with third-party service providers?

All our third-party service providers are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
