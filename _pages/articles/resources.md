This book builds upon the combination of Wardley Mapping, Domain-Driven Design, and Team Topologies for designing architectures that enable flow, which I introduced in the [User Needs Mapping book](/book).

- [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/){: target="_blank"} - The C4 Model website explains this hierarchical approach to software architecture diagrams, highlighting its four layers (system, container, component, code) and its goal of creating clear and consistent architecture views.

- [Collaborative Software Design](https://collaborative-software-design.com/){: target="_blank"} - The official website of the Collaborative Software Design book, by Kenny Baas-Schwegler, Evelyn van Kelle and Gien Verschatse, that provides an inside track on how to facilitate domain modelling decisions.

- [Domain‑Driven Design (DDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html){: target="_blank"} - Martin Fowler’s article introduces DDD as an approach to software development centred on modelling the problem domain. It explains the importance of developing a ubiquitous language and organising large domains into bounded contexts.

- [Independent Service Heuristics (ISH)](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/independent-service-heuristics-ish/){: target="_blank"} - The Open Practice Library describes ISH as a set of questions for finding natural boundaries between services and teams, helping organisations identify candidate value streams and domain boundaries. The page provides a detailed checklist and guidance on applying the heuristics.
