## Struggling to get started with User Needs Mapping? test

You’re not alone. Many teams and practitioners understand *why* aligning around user needs matters — but feel uncertain about *how* to begin.

This free, hands-on workshop is designed to bridge that gap.  
In just 90 minutes, you’ll walk through a **real User Needs Map** based on the same case study from the book *User Needs Mapping: Aligning Teams Around What Matters* — but with a fresh twist and a new scenario.  

You’ll gain **practical experience** applying the technique, surrounded by peers who are learning alongside you in a supportive, collaborative environment.

- 🧭 **A guided walkthrough** of the full User Needs Mapping process — from identifying users and needs to analysing dependencies and exploring team alignment.  
- 💡 **A new scenario** that extends the story from the book, helping you see how User Needs Mapping adapts to change.  
- 🧩 **Collaborative mapping** in small breakout groups, using Miro templates and shared facilitation prompts.  
- 🔄 **Reflection and discussion** on how to take the technique back into your own organisation.  
- 🎁 **Bonus resources** including downloadable templates, facilitator prompts, and a next-steps checklist.
