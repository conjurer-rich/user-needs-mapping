## Why Mapping Capabilities Matters

Mapping capabilities bridges the gap between understanding user needs and implementing solutions. Capabilities represent the combination of people, processes, skills, and technology required to meet user needs or support dependent capabilities. By mapping these capabilities and understanding their dependencies, you create a clear picture of how value flows through your organization and where there are opportunities for improvement.

## Key Actions

1. **Identify Capabilities:** For each user need, ask: *"**When [User] is trying to [Need], they need [Capability X], which needs [Capability Y], which needs [Capability Z]...and so on**"* Identify the systems, processes, skills, and technologies your organization uses to meet those needs.
2. **Build the Dependency Chain:** Think through how each capability relies on others to function effectively. Map these relationships to uncover dependencies.
3. **Highlight Gaps and Overlaps:** Identify where capabilities are missing, underperforming, or redundant in meeting user needs or supporting dependent capabilities.

## Mapping Capabilities Through Dependency Chains

Capabilities should represent the building blocks of your organization’s ability to deliver value. The process of mapping capabilities involves walking through the chain of needs and asking:

- **What does this user need?**
- **What capability enables that need?**
- **What additional capabilities does this depend on?**

### Example Thought Process

- *"When a commuter is trying to purchase a ticket, they will need a ticketing system."*
- *"When the ticketing system processes a purchase, it will need a payment processing framework."*
- *"When the payment processing framework operates, it will rely on system monitoring and support."*

This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of how capabilities interact and depend on one another.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Capability Workshops:** Collaborate with cross-functional teams to brainstorm and identify capabilities, starting with user needs and building dependency chains.
- **Dependency Diagrams:** Visualize how capabilities connect and depend on one another.
- **Capability Audit:** Assess existing capabilities to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for optimization.

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** A mobile ticketing company like [Passenger](/docs/case-studies/passenger) might identify the following capabilities:

- **For External Users:**
  - Ticketing system
  - Real-time journey update platform
- **For Internal Users:**
  - Customer support infrastructure
  - Payment processing framework

**Dependency Chain Example:**

1. **User Need:** Purchase a ticket.\
   **Primary Capability:** Ticketing system.\
   **Dependent Capabilities:** Payment processing framework, system monitoring, and customer support infrastructure.

2. **User Need:** Check real-time journey updates.\
   **Primary Capability:** Journey planning platform.\
   **Dependent Capabilities:** Data integration services, real-time API management.

By mapping these capabilities and their dependencies, the company gains a clear understanding of how each capability contributes to the overall user experience.

## Exercise

Map at least three capabilities to the user needs you defined in Step 3. Use these prompts to guide your thinking:

1. **What capabilities already exist to meet this need?**
2. **Are these capabilities sufficient, or are there gaps?**
3. **What other capabilities does this one depend on to function?**

## What’s Next?

With a clear map of your organizational capabilities and their dependencies, the next step is to visualize these dependencies in detail to understand how they impact delivery.\
