## Why Iterating and Scaling Matters

User Needs Mapping is not a one-time exercise. Organizations evolve, user needs change, and dependencies shift. To maintain alignment and deliver value effectively, itâ€™s essential to revisit and refine your User Needs Map regularly. Iteration helps you address emerging challenges, while scaling ensures the process remains effective as your organization grows.

---

## Key Actions

1. **Review Regularly:** Schedule periodic reviews to assess the accuracy of your User Needs Map and adapt to changes.
2. **Incorporate Feedback:** Gather input from teams to identify gaps, misalignments, or areas needing improvement.
3. **Scale Gradually:** Expand the process incrementally to cover new teams, capabilities, or value streams.

---

## Establishing an Iterative Process

1. **Set a Review Cadence:** Decide on a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually) to revisit your map.
2. **Evaluate Changes:** Ask questions like:
   - Have user needs evolved?
   - Are there new capabilities or dependencies?
   - Are current team boundaries still effective?
3. **Document Learnings:** Record observations and action items to guide the next iteration.

## Scaling Your User Needs Mapping Practice

1. **Start Small:** Focus on one team or value stream before expanding the practice organization-wide.
2. **Leverage Enabling Teams:** Use enabling teams to support other teams in adopting the User Needs Mapping process.
3. **Build a Knowledge Base:** Create centralized resources (e.g., templates, guides) to make scaling easier.

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** A mobile ticketing company revisits its User Needs Map six months after initial implementation:

1. **User Needs Update:**
   - New Need: Commuters want personalized journey suggestions.
   - Action: Add a "Journey Recommendation Engine" capability.

2. **Capability Refinements:**
   - Existing Capability: Real-Time Journey Update Platform now requires integration with third-party data providers.

3. **Team Boundary Adjustments:**
   - New Team: Data Integration Team created to manage third-party partnerships and API reliability.

This iterative approach ensures the organization adapts to evolving user needs while maintaining alignment.

## Exercise

Reflect on your User Needs Mapping process and consider the following:

1. **What has changed since your last review?**
2. **Are there new user needs or capabilities to add?**
3. **What improvements can be made to team boundaries or dependency management?**

Document your insights and plan your next iteration.
