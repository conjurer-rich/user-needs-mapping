## Why iterating and scaling matters

User Needs Mapping is not a one-time exercise. Organizations evolve, user needs change, and dependencies shift. To maintain alignment and deliver value effectively, itâ€™s essential to revisit and refine your User Needs Map regularly. Iteration helps you address emerging challenges, while scaling ensures the process remains effective as your organization grows.

---

## Key actions

1. **Review regularly:** Schedule periodic reviews to assess the accuracy of your User Needs Map and adapt to changes.
2. **Incorporate feedback:** Gather input from teams to identify gaps, misalignments, or areas needing improvement.
3. **Scale gradually:** Expand the process incrementally to cover new teams, capabilities, or value streams.

---

## Establishing an iterative process

1. **Set a review cadence:** Decide on a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually) to revisit your map.
2. **Evaluate changes:** Ask questions like:
   - Have user needs evolved?
   - Are there new capabilities or dependencies?
   - Are current team boundaries still effective?
3. **Document learnings:** Record observations and action items to guide the next iteration.

## Scaling your User Needs Mapping practice

1. **Start small:** Focus on one team or value stream before expanding the practice organization-wide.
2. **Leverage enabling teams:** Use enabling teams to support other teams in adopting the User Needs Mapping process.
3. **Build a knowledge base:** Create centralized resources (e.g., templates, guides) to make scaling easier.

---

## Exercise

Reflect on your User Needs Mapping process and consider the following:

1. **What has changed since your last review?**
2. **Are there new user needs or capabilities to add?**
3. **What improvements can be made to team boundaries or dependency management?**

Document your insights and plan your next iteration.

## Conclusion

User Needs Mapping is a continuous practice that evolves alongside your organization. By iterating and scaling, you ensure ongoing alignment, improved delivery, and the ability to adapt to change effectively. Ready to take your practice to the next level?
