**Team Topologies: Designing Teams for Fast Flow**  
Team Topologies provides a practical principles, patterns and practices for designing and structuring teams to optimize delivery speed and minimize cognitive load. These principles are key to creating effective team boundaries within any organization.

## Why Team Topologies?

Traditional team structures often create silos and inefficiencies, hindering value delivery. Team Topologies introduces a dynamic approach to team design based on two core principles:

1. **Fast flow of change:** Teams should be structured to deliver value quickly and with minimal friction.
2. **Cognitive load optimization:** Team responsibilities must be manageable without overwhelming members.

By aligning teams with these principles, organizations can achieve better collaboration, clearer ownership, and faster delivery.

Team Topologies was voted one of the best Project Management books of 2020.

## Key Concepts

### The four fundamental team types

![The four fundamental team types](/assets/images/teamtopologies/tt-four-team-types.png)

- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** Deliver value directly to users or customers by focusing on a specific stream of work (e.g., ticketing system or journey planning platform).
- **Enabling Teams:** Support stream-aligned teams by providing expertise or removing obstacles (e.g., data integration or DevOps enablement).
- **Complicated Subsystem Teams:** Manage areas of high technical complexity requiring specialized skills (e.g., machine learning models).
- **Platform <del>Teams</del> Grouping** Build and maintain reusable services or systems that other teams rely on (e.g., API platforms).

Although in the book the term "Platform Teams" is used, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais recommend using the term "Platform Grouping" since it is highly unlikely there will on ever be a single team that owns the platform. An organiztion may be made of multiple platform groupings all containing multiple stream-aligned teams within them.

### The three interaction modes

![The three interaction modes](/assets/images/teamtopologies/tt-three-interaction-modes.png)

1. **Collaboration:** Short-term, intensive work between teams to solve a specific problem or deliver a shared outcome.
2. **Facilitating:** One team helps another gain new skills or capabilities.
3. **X-as-a-Service:** One team provides services or resources to be consumed by another in a self-service manner, such as platform tools or APIs.

## How it fits with User Needs Mapping

![How it fits with User Needs Mapping](/assets/images/teamtopologies/Movie-goer-wider-journey-revised-team-overlay.png)

User Needs Mapping helps identify capabilities required to meet user needs. Team Topologies provides a structured way to assign ownership of these capabilities to the right teams.

For example:

- **Stream-Aligned Teams** can own capabilities directly tied to user needs (e.g., managing ticketing or real-time updates).
- **Platform Teams** support these capabilities by ensuring the necessary infrastructure is robust and scalable.
- **Enabling Teams** help remove bottlenecks or provide temporary expertise as new needs emerge.

Together, these approaches ensure teams are aligned, responsibilities are clear, and dependencies are minimized.
