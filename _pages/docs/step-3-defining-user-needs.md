**Why Defining User Needs Matters**  
After identifying your users, the next critical step is defining their needs. Clearly articulated user needs ensure your organization focuses on delivering outcomes that matter. This step bridges the gap between understanding your users and aligning organizational capabilities to meet their expectations.

---

## Key Actions

1. **Focus on Outcomes:** Frame needs based on what users want to achieve, not the solutions they might use.
2. **Use Verbs:** Describe user needs in terms of actions (e.g., "plan a journey" or "find support").
3. **Avoid Solutions:** Ensure needs describe problems or goals, not specific implementations.

---

## Guidelines for Writing User Needs

- **Be Specific:** Write needs that clearly define the user’s goal or challenge.
- **Validate with Users:** Check if the need resonates with the actual user group.
- **Describe the Problem:** Focus on the issue to solve, not the tool or system to solve it.

## Practical Examples

| Poorly Defined Need            | Well-Defined Need                    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| "Add a search feature."        | "Find products quickly and easily."  |
| "Build a reporting dashboard." | "Track progress and identify trends."|
| "Create a ticketing API."      | "Generate tickets automatically."    |

These examples show how outcome-focused needs drive clarity and actionable insights.

## Exercise

Write three user needs for one of the user groups you identified in Step 2. Use these prompts to guide your thinking:

1. **What is the user trying to achieve?**
2. **Would the user recognize this as their need?**
3. **Does this describe a problem rather than a solution?**

## What’s Next?

With well-defined user needs, the next step is to map the organizational capabilities required to meet them.
