## What is User Needs Mapping?

User Needs Mapping is a practical process for aligning teams, clarifying priorities, and simplifying complexity by focusing on the needs of both external and internal users. By identifying and prioritizing these needs, mapping capabilities, and defining clear team boundaries, organizations can deliver value more effectively while reducing dependencies and improving collaboration.
