## What is User Needs Mapping?

![User Needs Mapping](/assets/images/Movie-goer-full-user-needs-map.png)

User Needs Mapping is a practical process for aligning teams, clarifying priorities, and simplifying complexity by focusing on the needs of both external and internal users. By identifying and prioritizing these needs, mapping capabilities, and defining clear team boundaries, organizations can deliver value more effectively while reducing dependencies and improving collaboration.

## Why User Needs Mapping matters

- **Bridges strategy and execution:** Aligns high-level goals with actionable team-level priorities.
- **Solves misalignment:** Ensures that teams are working toward shared outcomes.
- **Simplifies complexity:** Reduces unnecessary dependencies and clarifies ownership.
- **Empowers collaboration:** Improves communication and coordination between Product, Tech, and other functions.

## The process

User Needs Mapping follows a step-by-step approach designed to provide clarity and alignment:

1. [**Define the Purpose:**](/docs/step-1-define-purpose) Establish the goals and scope of the mapping session.
2. [**Identify Users:**](/docs/step-2-identify-users) Understand the roles and needs of both external and internal users.
3. [**Define User Needs:**](/docs/step-3-defining-user-needs) Frame actionable, outcome-focused needs for each user group.
4. [**Map Capabilities:**](/docs/step-4-mapping-capabilities) Identify organizational capabilities required to meet user needs.
5. [**Visualize Dependencies:**](/docs/step-5-visualize-dependencies) Highlight overlaps and bottlenecks between teams and systems.
6. [**Define Team Boundaries:**](/docs/step-6-define-team-boundaries) Propose structures that align capabilities with user needs while reducing cognitive load.
7. [**Iterating and Scaling:**](/docs/step-7-iterating-and-scaling) Continuously refine the map as priorities and contexts evolve.
