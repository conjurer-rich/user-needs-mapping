[Passenger](https://passenger.tech), a mobile ticketing company, used User Needs Mapping to transform their team structure, reduce dependencies, and deliver value more effectively.

---

## Background

Passenger is a UK-based mobile ticketing company that provides white-label solutions for transport operators. With a growing customer base, their teams faced challenges scaling operations effectively:

- **Misaligned Teams:** Communication channels were overloaded, and responsibilities were unclear.
- **Exploding Dependencies:** Cross-team collaboration often caused delays and bottlenecks.
- **Unclear Boundaries:** A "big ball of mud" structure made it difficult to determine ownership.

These challenges led Passenger to explore User Needs Mapping as a way to align teams and improve delivery.

## Applying User Needs Mapping

### Step 1: Defining the Purpose

Passenger's leadership defined their goal as:  
*“Identify team boundaries that reduce dependencies and improve focus on delivering key user needs.”*

### Step 2: Identifying Users

Passenger identified the following key user groups:

- **External Users:** Commuters and transport operators.
- **Internal Users:** Customer support teams, platform engineers, and marketing teams.

### Step 3: Defining User Needs

The team articulated user needs such as:

- **Commuters:** Plan journeys, purchase tickets, receive real-time updates.
- **Transport Operators:** Publish schedules, monitor disruptions, meet regulatory requirements.

### Step 4: Mapping Capabilities

Capabilities mapped to these needs included:

- Ticketing system
- Journey planning platform
- Payment processing framework
- Real-time update system

### Step 5: Visualizing Dependencies

Passenger visualized dependencies between capabilities and identified critical paths, such as:

- **Ticketing System** → **Payment Processing Framework** → **System Monitoring**

### Step 6: Defining Team Boundaries

Based on dependencies, Passenger proposed new team structures:

- **Stream-Aligned Teams:**
  - Ticketing Team
  - Journey Planning Team
- **Platform Team:**
  - API Platform Team
- **Enabling Team:**
  - Data Insights Team

## Outcomes

Passenger achieved significant improvements:

- **Reduced Dependencies:** Clear ownership minimized cross-team delays.
- **Improved Focus:** Stream-aligned teams could concentrate on delivering value to specific user groups.
- **Scalable Structure:** New team boundaries supported the company’s growth.

## Key Takeaways

Passenger’s success demonstrates the power of User Needs Mapping to:

- Align teams around user needs.
- Simplify dependencies and clarify ownership.
- Enable scalable, adaptive team structures.
