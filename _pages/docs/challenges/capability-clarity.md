## Challenge: Lack of Clarity Around Capabilities

Teams often struggle to map capabilities to user needs, particularly when there is a lack of understanding about existing systems, processes, or tools. This can lead to incomplete maps or missed opportunities to address critical gaps.

---

## Strategies to Improve Capability Clarity

### 1. Audit Existing Capabilities

Conduct an inventory of current systems, tools, and processes. Understand what is already in place and how it supports user needs.

### 2. Engage Domain Experts

Collaborate with subject matter experts who understand specific capabilities and their dependencies. This ensures a comprehensive and accurate map.

### 3. Visualize Dependencies

Create diagrams or dependency trees to illustrate how capabilities relate to one another and to user needs. Visuals can reveal hidden gaps or bottlenecks.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Use Simple Terms:** Avoid jargon when describing capabilities to ensure alignment across teams.
- **Focus on Functionality:** Map what a capability enables, not how it works.
- **Iterate and Refine:** Update your maps as new capabilities are developed or identified.

## Example: Mapping Capabilities

**Scenario:** A software company struggles to map capabilities for their customer support function.

### Approach

1. **Audit:** List existing tools like the ticketing system, knowledge base, and analytics platform.
2. **Engage Experts:** Involve customer support managers to detail how these tools interact.
3. **Visualize:** Create a dependency tree:

```text
User Need: Resolve a Customer Issue
  |
  V
Ticketing System ---> Knowledge Base ---> Analytics Platform
```

This visualization highlights how each capability contributes to resolving customer issues.

---

## Exercise

To clarify capabilities in your User Needs Map:

1. List all current systems, processes, and tools in use.
2. Identify which user needs they support.
3. Draw a diagram showing dependencies between capabilities.
