## Challenge: Resistance to Change

Introducing User Needs Mapping can meet resistance from teams and leadership. This reluctance often stems from a lack of understanding, fear of disruption, or skepticism about its value.

## Strategies to Overcome Resistance

### 1. Start Small

Begin with a pilot project for one team or department. Focus on delivering quick wins that demonstrate the value of User Needs Mapping.

### 2. Involve Stakeholders Early

Engage team members and leadership in the process from the start. Explain the benefits and show how the approach aligns with organizational goals.

### 3. Highlight Success Stories

Share examples from other organizations, such as [Passengerâ€™s Case Study](/docs/passenger-case-study/), to build confidence and excitement.
