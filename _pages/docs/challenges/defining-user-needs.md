## Challenge: Difficulty Defining User Needs

Teams often struggle to articulate user needs clearly. This can occur due to a lack of direct user interaction, reliance on vague or solution-oriented language, or limited cross-functional collaboration.

## Strategies to Define User Needs

### 1. Use User-Centric Language

Focus on framing user needs as actions or goals. Avoid describing solutions or systems directly. For example:

- Poor: "Ticket purchase system" - describes an underlying system
- Better: "Buy a ticket" - describes the action the user wants to do
- Best: "Get valid access to travel to a destination" - describes the outcome the user wants

Often when you ask users what they want, they will describe the solution rather than the need and can be tricky to tease out the underlying need. However, it is the uncovering of the underlying need that begins to enable innovative thinking and creative solutions - does the user really need to buy a ticket to travel - what other means might they obtain valid access to travel?

### 2. Validate with Real Users

Where possible, engage directly with users to confirm that defined needs reflect their experiences and expectations. User interviews, surveys, or feedback sessions can provide invaluable insights.

If you are looking to get started with ways to better engage with your users, I highly recommend taking a look at Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres:

### 3. Collaborate Cross-Functionally

Involve team members from diverse functions, such as customer support, product management, and marketing. This ensures a well-rounded perspective on user needs and reduces blind spots.

## Practical Tips

- **Use Verbs:** Focus on actions users are trying to achieve. Verbs help keep needs actionable and outcome-focused.
- **Test Clarity:** Ask, "Would a user recognize this as their need?" If not, refine the language.
- **Avoid Solutions:** Keep needs focused on the problem, not the implementation.

## Examples of User Needs

| Poorly Defined Need            | Well-Defined Need                    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| "Add a reporting dashboard."   | "Track progress and identify trends."|
| "Create a ticketing API."       | "Generate tickets automatically."    |
| "Improve search functionality." | "Find relevant products quickly."    |

## Exercise

Work with your team to define user needs using the following prompts:

1. **What is the user trying to achieve?**
2. **Would the user recognize this as their need?**
3. **Does this describe the problem rather than the solution?**
