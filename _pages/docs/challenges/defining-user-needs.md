## Challenge: Difficulty Defining User Needs

Teams often struggle to articulate user needs clearly. This can occur due to a lack of direct user interaction, reliance on vague or solution-oriented language, or limited cross-functional collaboration.

---

## Strategies to Define User Needs

### 1. Use User-Centric Language

Focus on framing user needs as actions or goals. Avoid describing solutions or systems directly. For example:

- Poor: "Ticket purchase system"
- Better: "Buy a ticket"

### 2. Validate with Real Users

Where possible, engage directly with users to confirm that defined needs reflect their experiences and expectations. User interviews, surveys, or feedback sessions can provide invaluable insights.

### 3. Collaborate Cross-Functionally

Involve team members from diverse functions, such as customer support, product management, and marketing. This ensures a well-rounded perspective on user needs and reduces blind spots.

## Practical Tips

- **Use Verbs:** Focus on actions users are trying to achieve. Verbs help keep needs actionable and outcome-focused.
- **Test Clarity:** Ask, "Would a user recognize this as their need?" If not, refine the language.
- **Avoid Solutions:** Keep needs focused on the problem, not the implementation.

## Examples of User Needs

| Poorly Defined Need            | Well-Defined Need                    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| "Add a reporting dashboard."   | "Track progress and identify trends."|
| "Create a ticketing API."       | "Generate tickets automatically."    |
| "Improve search functionality." | "Find relevant products quickly."    |

## Exercise

Work with your team to define user needs using the following prompts:

1. **What is the user trying to achieve?**
2. **Would the user recognize this as their need?**
3. **Does this describe the problem rather than the solution?**
