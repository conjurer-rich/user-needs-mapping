## Challenge: Overwhelming Complexity

For large organizations with many users and capabilities, the User Needs Mapping process can quickly become overwhelming. When maps are too broad or complex, it becomes difficult to extract actionable insights and maintain focus.

---

## Strategies to Manage Complexity

### 1. Break It Down

Focus on one user group or a specific area of the business at a time. Create smaller, targeted maps that address specific needs rather than attempting to map the entire organization at once.

### 2. Prioritize Critical Needs

Identify the most critical user needs and capabilities that have the greatest impact on value delivery. Address these areas first to ensure progress is made where it matters most.

### 3. Iterate

Treat User Needs Mapping as a continuous process. Begin with a high-level overview and refine it over multiple sessions as new insights emerge.

## Practical Tips

- **Use Layers:** Start with a simple map and add complexity in stages as needed.
- **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define the scope of each mapping session to avoid unnecessary sprawl.
- **Engage Smaller Groups:** Work with focused groups of stakeholders to manage discussions effectively.

## Example of Breaking Down Complexity

**Scenario:** A large e-commerce company struggles with mapping all their users and capabilities in one session.

### Approach

1. **Define Scope:** Focus on a single value stream, such as "Order Fulfillment."
2. **Prioritize Needs:** Identify top user needs, such as "Track an order" and "Return an item."
3. **Map Incrementally:** Create separate maps for logistics, customer support, and inventory management, then integrate them iteratively.

---

## Exercise

To reduce complexity in your maps:

1. Choose one user group or value stream to focus on.
2. Identify the top three user needs for that group.
3. Map only the capabilities directly related to these needs.
4. Evaluate the results before expanding the scope.
