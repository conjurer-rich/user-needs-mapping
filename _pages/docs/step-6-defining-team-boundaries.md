## Why Defining Team Boundaries Matters

Clear and effective team boundaries are essential for reducing dependencies, minimizing cognitive load, and enabling teams to deliver value quickly. Aligning team structures with mapped capabilities ensures teams can take full ownership of their work while avoiding bottlenecks caused by excessive coordination.

---

## Key Actions

1. **Analyze Dependency Diagrams:** Use the dependency diagrams from Step 5 to identify areas where dependencies can be minimized by aligning capabilities.
2. **Propose Team Boundaries:** Group related capabilities into team boundaries that reduce cross-team dependencies and maximize autonomy.
3. **Validate Boundaries:** Evaluate if the proposed boundaries align with cognitive load principles and support fast delivery.

---

## Principles for Defining Team Boundaries

1. **Minimize Dependencies:** Aim for team boundaries that require the least amount of coordination with other teams.
2. **Align with User Needs:** Structure teams around capabilities that directly support user needs, ensuring clarity of purpose.
3. **Consider Cognitive Load:** Ensure the team’s scope of responsibility is manageable without overwhelming its members.

## Team Types to Consider

Based on Team Topologies principles, consider these types of teams when defining boundaries:

- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** Own a specific user need or value stream, such as ticketing or journey planning.
- **Enabling Teams:** Provide expertise or tools to help stream-aligned teams succeed, such as a platform engineering team.
- **Complicated Subsystem Teams:** Manage specialized areas requiring deep expertise, such as machine learning models.
- **Platform Teams:** Build and maintain foundational capabilities used across multiple teams, such as APIs or infrastructure.

---

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** A mobile ticketing company defines team boundaries based on their mapped capabilities:

- **Stream-Aligned Teams:**
  - Ticketing Team: Responsible for the ticketing system and user experience.
  - Journey Planning Team: Manages the journey planning platform and real-time updates.
- **Platform Team:**
  - API Platform Team: Ensures reliable APIs for internal and external integration.
- **Enabling Team:**
  - Data Insights Team: Provides data analytics to support decision-making for stream-aligned teams.

By aligning teams with capabilities, the company reduces dependencies and ensures clear ownership of key systems.

## Exercise

Define team boundaries for the capabilities you mapped in Step 4 and visualized in Step 5. Use these prompts:

1. **Which capabilities naturally group together?**
2. **Can a single team take full ownership of these capabilities?**
3. **What dependencies remain, and how can they be minimized?**

## What’s Next?

With team boundaries defined, the next step is to establish a process for iterating and scaling your User Needs Mapping practice as your organization evolves.
