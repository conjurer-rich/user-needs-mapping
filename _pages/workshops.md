    title="1. Consulting — partner with me to evolve your organisation"
    main_content="When you need more than advice, I roll up my sleeves and work with you in your context — typically over 6–12 months. Together we’ll apply User Needs Mapping across your value streams, uncover hidden friction, and guide structural decisions that improve flow and alignment. Expect a hands-on partnership where we facilitate mapping sessions, sense organisational signals, and help leaders and teams evolve boundaries, interactions, and strategy iteratively — not through another big-bang reorg.

- Typical investment: £8–25k / month depending on scope and duration.
- Best for: organisations scaling fast or facing recurring misalignment between strategy and delivery.
- I usually begin with 3–6 months of consulting and then transition to ongoing coaching support once the foundations are in place."

    title="2. Workshops — accelerate clarity and alignment"
    main_content="Focused, high-impact sessions designed to solve specific challenges using User Needs Mapping as a lens for fast, shared understanding.

Common formats include:

Diagnosing misalignment — see where effort and user needs have drifted apart.
Team Topologies alignment — evolve boundaries and interactions safely.
Platform and enablement design — clarify internal users and streamline flow.
Strategy activation — connect objectives to user needs and value delivery.

Each workshop is immersive and outcome-driven. You’ll leave with a tangible artefact — your map — and a clear set of next steps.

Typical investment: £15–20k per team or leadership group.
Duration: 1–2 days (in-person or remote)."

    title="3. Coaching — ongoing guidance and reflection"
    main_content="Once you’ve started applying User Needs Mapping, coaching provides a structured way to sustain momentum. I act as your thought partner and sounding board — helping leaders, change agents, and practitioners sense and respond to evolving organisational needs.

Sessions are typically 60 minutes weekly or bi-weekly, with asynchronous support in between (Slack, WhatsApp, or email).

 I help you think through decisions such as:

How to handle emerging dependencies and cognitive load issues.
How to refine team interactions without destabilising delivery.
How to integrate UNM with approaches like Team Topologies, Wardley Mapping, or Flow Engineering.

Typical investment: £3–4k / month per group (3–7 participants).
Format: 1:1 or small-group."

    title="How we’ll begin"
    main_content="Most engagements start with a conversation to explore your current context — what’s slowing your flow, where alignment breaks down, and what outcomes matter most. Together we’ll design the right blend of workshops, consulting, and coaching to fit your goals, time, and budget.

I believe in progress through clarity. Let’s start by mapping where you are."
