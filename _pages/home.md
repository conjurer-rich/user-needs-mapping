## What is User Needs Mapping?
User Needs Mapping (UNM) is a powerful technique designed to help organizations and teams understand the relationship between their users the underlying capabilities required to support them. Building upon principles from Wardley Mapping, Jobs to Be Done, User Journeys, and Team Topologies, UNM offers a structured approach to help define effective team boundaries and service ownership.

Born from the practical challenges of helping teams organize themselves around user needs, it has become a "go-to" tool within the Team Topologies community.

## Why Use User Needs Mapping?
Organizations often struggle with aligning their teams and services to deliver value effectively. UNM addresses this by:

- Providing a clear user-centered view of the system.
- Highlighting capabilities needed to support user journeys.
- Offering insights into team boundaries and potential areas of cognitive overload.
- Supporting the decomposition of platforms into manageable team-owned services.

## How Does It Work?
The UNM process involves:

1. **Identifying users and needs:** Understand who your users are and what specific needs you are seeking to satisfy.

2. **Identifying capabilities:** Define the underlying technical or organizational capabilities required to support these user needs.

3. **Grouping capabilities:** Organize capabilities into logical groupings, considering factors like team cognitive load and service ownership.

4. **Validating with teams:** Engage your teams in discussions to refine groupings and align on shared understanding.

## Common Challenges and Tips
While UNM is intuitive, some challenges may arise:

- **First-Time Insights:**
  Initial maps may confirm known assumptions. Focus on using discussions to uncover deeper insights.

- **Cognitive Load Estimation:**
  Capabilities might be grouped too broadly. Consider weighting them based on complexity or dependencies.

- **Tooling:**
  Tools like Miro, Mural, Excalidraw can enhance collaboration and make visualizing and iterating on the map easier.

## Unexpected Benefits
Even if insights feel predictable, the structured discussions fostered by UNM provide clarity and alignment across teams. Participants often leave with a deeper understanding of their organization’s needs and priorities.

## Adopted widely in the Team Topologies Community
UNM has grown from a personal “itch to scratch” into a trusted technique embraced by practitioners worldwide. Its simplicity and adaptability make it an invaluable part of any team’s toolkit when designing humane and effective ways of working.
