    main_content="Disconnected Product and Engineering teams lead to **silos**, **delays**, and **frustration**. We need to align those teams through conversations about user needs and how the work they do aligns with the organizations purpose. This is where User Needs Mapping comes in. It is a **practical**, **accessible**, and **scalable** approach that can be used by teams of any size, with or without prior experience of techniques like Wardley Mapping or Domain-Driven Design.
    \\
    \\
    With User Needs Mapping we seek to start (and continue) conversations between product and engineering teams that align them around the needs of the users they serving. We do this by **visualizing the value chain** which helps teams to understand the **flow of value** through the organization and then determine how they might best align to deliver that value most effectively."
