    title="The result of accidental complexity"
    description="Your organization is made up of **people, processes, and technology** (a socio-technical system). As the organization grows, it becomes more complex. The technical systems become larger and more processes are introduced to try to manage dependencies between the systems but we often don't pay enough attention to the people part of the overall system."

    description="Your **Customer, Market and Technology** are the three main drivers of value in your organization. They are continuously evolving and the rate of change is only increasing. Organizations need to be able to respond to these changes quickly and effectively. This means being able to sense when to change i.e. **spot the signals** and then act quickly to respond."

    title="The Journey to Success"
    description="User Needs Mapping is a technique that helps you to align your teams around the needs of your users. It is a practical, accessible, and scalable approach that can be used by teams of any size, with or without prior experience in advanced frameworks such as Wardley Mapping or Domain-Driven Design.<br> We seek to start a conversation between product and engineering teams to align around the needs of the users we are trying to serve. We do this via visualizing the value chain which helps us to understand the flow of value through the organization."
