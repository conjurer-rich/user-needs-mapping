    main_content="It’s a practical, visual approach to reconnect your organisation’s effort with what users actually need—so you can make better decisions, reduce friction, and restore momentum.

When teams lose sight of user needs, predictable patterns emerge:

- Features no one uses
- Unclear ownership and blurred boundaries
- Endless dependencies and coordination overhead
- Burnout from trying to do everything at once

User Needs Mapping – Aligning Teams Around What Matters shows you how to break that cycle. Through real examples, step-by-step guidance, and visual tools, you’ll learn how to make user needs visible, clarify responsibilities, and evolve team interactions for fast, sustainable flow of value.

If you’ve ever asked yourself, “Why do good teams with good intentions still end up working at cross purposes?” — this book gives you the answer.
