    title="About me"
    main_content="I’m Rich Allen, an independent sociotechnical architect, consultant, and author of User Needs Mapping: Aligning Teams Around What Matters. With over two decades of experience across engineering, product, and organisational design, I’ve helped companies across the UK and Europe improve clarity, reduce friction, and reconnect their teams to the outcomes that matter.

As one of the earliest contributors to the development and teaching of Team Topologies, I’ve spent years helping organisations apply modern, humane, flow-centric approaches to team design. My work blends mapping techniques, systems thinking, organisational sense-making, and practical facilitation to help leaders and teams make better structural decisions with confidence.

You can find more about my background and broader consultancy work here: [https://richallen.info](https://richallen.info)

    title="How I help"
    main_content="I work with leaders, product managers, CTOs, architects, and transformation teams through:

- **Consulting**  
  Deep-engagement partnerships (typically 6–12 months) to help organisations apply User Needs Mapping, sense structural friction, and evolve team interactions for better flow.

- **Workshops**  
  High-impact, hands-on sessions to help teams build their first maps, diagnose misalignment, and explore safe-to-try structural improvements.

- **Coaching**  
  Ongoing thought partnership — weekly or bi-weekly — for leaders and practitioners who want a sounding board for decisions around flow, team boundaries, and organisational evolution.

You can learn more about these options on the [Workshops & Consulting page](/workshops)."
