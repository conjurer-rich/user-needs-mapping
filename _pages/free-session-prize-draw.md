I hope you enjoyed the Fast Flow Conference, unfortunately, the prize draw is now closed.

I had a really great time and it was amazing to meet so many awesome people interested in introducing faster flow into their organisations and using User Needs Mapping to help them. I'm always looking for stories and case studies about how User Needs Mapping is helping or has helped people in the real world, if you have any stories, let me know.

I'd love to connect with you and understand a bit more about how you think User Needs Mapping might be useful for your organisation, let's connect: <i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin" title="LinkedIn"></i>
